### 3. Educational Value (0-100)

- Is it at the appropriate Bloom's level?
- Does it align with learning objectives?

### 4. Source Alignment (0-100)
- Is the question supported by provided source materials?
- Are citations accurate?
- Does it stay within the scope of the materials?

### 5. Bias Check (PASS/FAIL)

## Output Format

    "question_id": "q1",
    "overall_score": 85,
    "is_valid": true,
    "scores": {
        "content_accuracy": 90,
        "clarity": 85,
        "educational_value": 80,
        "source_alignment": 85
    },
    "bias_check": "PASS",
    "issues": [
        {
            "type": "MINOR",

            "suggestion": "Reword to: ..."
        }
    ],
    "requires_revision": false,
    "auto_fix_applied": false,
    "revised_question": null
}
```

## Issue Types
- **CRITICAL**: Question is incorrect or fundamentally flawed (requires_revision: true)
- **MAJOR**: Significant clarity or accuracy issues (requires_revision: true)  
- **MINOR**: Small improvements possible (requires_revision: false)
- **SUGGESTION**: Optional enhancements (requires_revision: false)

## Guidelines
- Be thorough but fair in assessment
- Provide actionable feedback for improvements
- For minor issues, suggest specific fixes
- A question with overall_score >= 70 and no CRITICAL/MAJOR issues is valid
- Auto-fix minor issues when possible and set auto_fix_applied: true
